    \emph{Syntax-Guided Synthesis (SyGuS)} is the computational problem of finding an implementation $f$
    that meets both a semantic constraint given by a logical formula $\varphi$ in a background theory $T$,
    and a syntactic constraint given by a grammar $G$,
    which specifies the allowed set of candidate implementations.
    Such a synthesis problem can be formally defined in the SyGuS Input Format (SyGuS-IF),
    a language that is built on top of SMT-LIB.
    
    
    The \emph{Syntax-Guided Synthesis Competition (\comp)} is an
    effort to facilitate, bring together and accelerate research and development of efficient
    solvers for SyGuS by providing a platform for evaluating different synthesis
    techniques on a comprehensive set of benchmarks. 
    In this year's competition, five solvers competed on over 1600 benchmarks.
    This paper presents and analyses the results of the 5\textsuperscript{th} \comp{} held in 2018.
