    \emph{Syntax-guided synthesis (SyGuS)} is the computational problem of finding an implementation $f$
    that meets both a semantic constraint given by a logical formula $\varphi$ in a background theory $T$,
    and a syntactic constraint given by a grammar $G$,
    which specifies the allowed set of candidate implementations.
    Such a synthesis problem can be formally defined in the \emph{SyGuS input format (SyGuS-IF)},
    a language that is built on top of SMT-LIB.
    
    
    The \emph{syntax-guided synthesis competition (\comp)} is an
    effort to facilitate, bring together and accelerate research and development of efficient
    solvers for SyGuS by providing a platform for evaluating different synthesis
    techniques on a comprehensive set of benchmarks. 
    In the 5\textsuperscript{th} \comp{}, five solvers competed on over 1600 benchmarks across various tracks.
    This paper presents and analyses the results of this year's (2018) SyGuS competition.
