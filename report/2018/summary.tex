\section{Summary}
\label{sec:discussion}

This year's competition consisted of over $1600$ benchmarks, $107$ of which where contributed this year.
Five solvers competed this year, one of which was submitted by developers creating a tool for SyGuS-Comp for the first time.
All tools preformed remarkably well, on both existing and new benchmarks.
In particular, more than $74$\% of the current set of benchmarks from the general track are now solved.
However, there are several classes of problems that are still challenging for the current solvers,
especially the ``Instruction Selection'' and ``Multiple Functions'' categories;
and we hope the developers would continue to improve their SyGuS techniques and advance the state of the art.
